This two-hour workshop will provide an overview and brief hands-on introduction to big data research in the social sciences. The first half will cover fundamental concepts, major methods, and prominent research examples in social data science. The second half will present an interactive tutorial/demonstration in python with real data. We will end the session with a discussion of problems and issues in big data research, as well as resources and guidance for further learning.
